1 - What is one important difference between tuples and lists?
    Tuples are immutable

2 - What are two ways to create a tuple?
    Create a comma-separated list of values; or use the built-in function tuple.

3 - Give an example of tuple assignment to assign two variables.
    t = tuple(m, n)

4 - Why is it beneficial to return a tuple from a function?
    Function can only return one value, this way we can "pack" the values in tuple

5 - What are variable-length arguments?
    The syntax *args in function def-s is used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function.
    def myFun(*argv):
    for arg in argv:
        print (arg)

6 - How is gather and scatter used?
    One can call * a gather parameter (when used in function arguments definition) or a scatter operator (when used at function invocation).

7 - What does the zip function do?
    zip is a built-in function taking two or more sequences and “zips” them into a list of tuples where each tuple contains one element from each sequence (length of the shorter one).

8 - What does the items method do?
    Dictionary method that returns list of tuples, each tuple being key-value pair.

9 - How are tuples compared when relational operators are used?
    Tuples are compared position by position: the first item of first tuple is compared to the first item of the second tuple.
