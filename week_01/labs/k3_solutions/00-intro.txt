0 - Why do we not program in plain English (or another natural language)?
    * Computers would not understand it.

1 - What is the difference between an interpretor and a compiler?
    Which is used for Python?
    * Both process high-level languages into low-level languages.
    Interpreter reads the porgram and executes it, doing what the program says; step by step.
    Complier reads the program and translates it completely before running the program.
    Python programs are executed by an interpreter.

2 - What are two ways to execute Python code?
    * Interactive mode and script mode.

3 - How do you execute a Python script?
    * You tell the interpreter the name of the file. (Preceeded by 'python')

4 - In your own words describe what a program is
    and what programs are made up of.
    * A program is a sequence of instructions, usually breaking a bigger more complex task into smaller subtasks.

5 - What are the main three types of errors and how do you come across them?
    * Syntax errors - if the structure of a program or rules are not followed
    Runtime errors - appears after the program has started running; also called exceptions.
    Semantic errors - Program will run ok, but it will not do the right thing but something else.

6 - What does it mean to debug a program?
    What are some ways to debug a program?
    * Trying to figure out what is wrong with the program, what are the errors. You make an hyopthesis and modify the program and run again.

7 - What is a “high-level language” / what’s a “low-level-language”?
    * high-level languages have to be processed into low-level before they can run. It takes time but they are easier to write, read and they are shorter.
