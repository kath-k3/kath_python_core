## vim
- in terminal: vim
- in insert mode: "I'm writing in vim"
- esc, :wq <filename>
- #search in vim:
    :greap "pattern" *.txt


## advanced CLI
 - What is the difference between the two commands > and >>?
    The >> appends to a file or creates the file if it doesn't exist.
    The > overwrites the file or creates it if it doesn't exist.
    Examples:
    ($ ls > allmyfiles.txt creates the file "allmyfiles.txt" and fills it with the directory listing from the ls command

    $ echo "End of directory listing" >> allmyfiles.txt adds "End of directory listing" to the end of the file "allmyfiles.txt")

- Append some text of a file to another file
    $ grep text old_file.txt >> new_file.txt

- Overwrite the content of my_file.txt with "tell me"

**grep [options] pattern [files]
