3 - Cloning repository from Github:
    - create a new folder in your CodingNomads folder called labs
    - if you haven't already, clone this repository inside of your labs folder
    - create a new Github repository with the same name as the repository that you cloned
    - add a new remote to your local git repository that points to your Github
    - push the repository to your Github
    - visit the Github repository to make sure the contents were pushed

cd CodingNomads/
mkdir labs
git clone https://github.com/kath-k3/python_core/
cd labs, mkdir python_core
git remote add origin
git push -u origin --all
/not sure I am in a right place?/



4 - Initializing a new git repository:
    - in your CodingNomads folder, create new folder git_practice
    - inside git_practice:
        - initialize folder as a git folder (make sure you are in the correct folder when initializing)
        - make new file
        - add file
        - commit file
        - on Github, create new git_practice repository
        - add remote that points to the Github repository
        - push committed file to Github
        - practice the following git flow until you feel comfortable:
            - Create or modify file
            - Add file(s)
            - Commit file(s)
            - Push file(s) to Github repository

mkdir git_practice
cd git_practice
git init
echo "text" > filename.txt
git add filename.txt
git commit -m "Made such and such changes"
git remote add origin https://github.com/kath-k3/git_practice  (verify: git remote -v)


5 - More practice cloning
    - spend some time looking at the repositories on Github
    - find three projects that interest you and clone them to your local machine (in a new folder inside of CodingNomads)
    - create repositories on your Github for each project
    - add remotes to each local repo
    - push each repo to your Github
